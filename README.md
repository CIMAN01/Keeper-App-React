# Keeper-App-React

A React-based todo-list app that mimicks (and is inspired by) the Google keep app, where you create and delete sticky notes. 

The app implements common React features such as components, modules, hooks, and object/array destructuring just to name a few.

To run the app, make sure to run 'npm install' in the cli in order to use all the necessary modules/dependencies required by the json package. Next, open up a browser tab and run 'npm start' from the main app directory to launch the app.
